# About Me
I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://www.mtsu.edu/csc/index.php) at the Middle Tennessee State University. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Miami, under supervision of Prof. [Jie Xu](https://sites.google.com/site/jiexuhomepage/home) in 2023. From 2015 to 2018, I worked in [ZTE Corporation](https://www.zte.com.cn/global/) as a Software Engineer. Prior to that, I received my M.S. and B.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Shanghai University and Shanghai Normal University in 2015 and 2012, respectively.

<o>Opening: I am looking for self-motivated PhD/master/undergraduate students to join my group. Please send me a short email with your C.V. and anything you believe relevant!</o>

### Research Interests:
- Mobile Edge Computing/Intelligence
- AI/Machine Learning for networks
- Systems for AI/Machine Learning
